"""Which levers this turn gets, and at what strength.

There are exactly three ways this stack can push a performance towards an attribute:

  **adapter**  a rank-16 LoRA at a merge weight.  What this server already does.
  **steer**    a difference-of-means direction added to the hidden state (`steer_engine.py`).
  **cfg**      classifier-free guidance on the delivery condition (`tts_engine.py`).

This module owns the policy: given what the director asked for and what the wiki says has
been measured for that attribute, it decides which levers actually run.  It decides nothing
by taste — every rule below is a measurement, and the one that produced it is named.

THE SHAPE OF THE EVIDENCE, in one table.  Main effects on the target, in SD units, from the
2x2x2 factorial (`combination-study/stats/analysis.json`, `t2.by_family`):

    family      adapter        steering       guidance
    emotion     +0.077 (2.8)   +0.384 (9.4)   +0.050 (1.8)
    delivery    +0.377 (7.1)   +0.614 (9.6)   +0.026 (0.4)
    quality     +0.399 (6.0)   +0.006 (0.0)   +0.062 (0.9)

Three rules fall straight out of it, and they are why `auto` resolves the way it does:

  * **Emotion: adapter and steering are additive** (interaction +0.038, t 1.36 — not
    significant), so `adapter+steer` is predictable and is the default there.
  * **Delivery: pick one.**  adapter x steering is -0.164 (t -3.7) and adapter x guidance is
    -0.125 (t -3.5); both are significantly sub-additive because the two levers are doing the
    same job.  The incumbent adapter wins by default (`config.DELIVERY_LEVER`).
  * **Quality: adapter only.**  Steering does nothing at all there (+0.006, t 0.0), and the
    quality directions break at k >= 2 layers.

And two rules about combining:

  * **Steering x guidance is the only real synergy, and it is a coupled package.**  +0.277
    (t 7.5) on the emotion target — while the same term carries +0.078 word error (t 11.8),
    -0.862 genuineness (t -21.5) and -0.070 burst realisation (t -6.7).  Every damage term
    has a larger |t| than the gain.  When both are on, both branches are steered, which keeps
    82 % of the effect and returns 0.209 of word error and 0.75 of genuineness.
  * **Subtracting `Emotional_Numbness` at -0.10 is free.**  It returns +0.60 of genuineness
    (t 9.64, on 67 of 80 prompts) at no cost in emotion when the adapter carries the emotion,
    so it rides along automatically on any emotion turn that has the steering machinery
    running.

WHERE THE WIKI SAYS THERE IS NOTHING, THIS MODULE REFUSES.  Seven of the sixty attributes
have no configuration that clears the balanced guardrails.  For those the levers are not
offered at a guessed setting; the turn runs on the adapter and the payload says why.  That is
the whole point of the knowledge layer: an absent recommendation is a finding.
