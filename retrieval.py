"""Match the director's prose against the reference corpus.

The director writes how the line should sound — a standing GENERAL description
plus a bracketed cue on every sentence.  That prose, concatenated, is embedded
with the VoiceCLAP-commercial text tower and matched against the index built by
build_retrieval_index.py, which gives back three things: the reference clip to
condition on, the emotion whose adapter to merge, and the measured scores of
what was picked.

Two measured facts shape how the matching is done.

Anisotropy: raw cosines in this space sit in a narrow band around 0.9 and a few
conditions are near-neighbours of everything, so both sides are mean-centred
first.  On a 40-way held-out set of director prose that moves top-1 from 0.35 to
0.61 against the text anchors and from 0.22 to 0.44 against the audio centroids.

Single clips are noisy: classifying one clip's audio embedding against 40
emotion captions scores 0.071, which is precisely the emonet top-1 on this
model's own card.  Averaging a condition's takes into a centroid is what makes
the audio side usable at all, so nothing here matches against a lone clip.
