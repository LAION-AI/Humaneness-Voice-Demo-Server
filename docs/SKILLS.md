# The measured knowledge layer, and what it changed

`wikiskills/` is a generated corpus of everything six weeks of experiments
established: sixty attribute pages, a machine-readable `coefficients.json` that
the lever planner already reads, and `VOCAL_BURSTS.md`, which is the part that
changes what the **director** writes.

`skills.py` parses those burst tables at boot and uses them in three places. The
tables are parsed rather than transcribed, for the same reason the wiki is
generated rather than typed: a copy stops agreeing with its source the moment
either moves.

## It corrects two things this server was getting wrong

**We were telling the director to do the one thing measured to hurt.** The
shipped instruction said to put bursts *mid-sentence*. Measured, mid-clause
placement is worse on **15 of 15** classes tested — hit rate −0.07 to −0.12, miss
rate +0.31 to +0.37, t 8–10. The single inversion is `clears_throat`, which is
genuinely better mid-sentence, and the new block says so.

**We were offering sounds that do not exist.** Of the 71 burst adapters on disk,
**36 are measured as never realising at any dose, or below the 0.15 shipping
bar** — every mouth class and every whistle class in the bank is among them. The
old prompt offered all 71. Asking for one produces a silent gap and no warning.
The new block offers 36 and names the rest as unavailable.

And one thing it did not know: **the useful merge weight is per class**, running
0.25 to 2.3 against the flat 0.25 / 0.5 shipped here. `chuckle` alone goes from
0.25 to its measured 2.0.

## What the director is now told

Beyond the list, five rules, each with the measurement behind it:

| rule | measured |
|---|---|
| put the burst between sentences, not inside one | −0.07…−0.12 hit, 15/15 classes worse |
| name the sound's **cause** in the GENERAL line | +0.026 hit |
| give a burst that matters a longer stated duration | +0.022, and +0.044 with the cause sentence |
| write the sound, never the action that makes it | "(he chuckles)" degrades to silence, −0.08…−0.11 |
| do not substitute a neighbouring class | null on family, a significant *harm* on strict (−0.021, t −2.9) |

The list itself is ordered by measured hit rate and split at 0.40, so the
director reaches for the reliable sounds first.

## The v2 adapter release, served per class

The 105-adapter release adds five serving arms beside the original 71. Which arm
serves a class is **not** a global setting: each class's own page names the arm
that won for it, and the merge rule moved some while most stayed. Read from the
pages at boot, that resolves to

| arm | classes |
|---|--:|
| the original set | 35 |
| `bulk_mix_full` (per class) | 12 |
| `ablation_d2_matched` | 2 |
| `bulk_mix_top1` | 1 |

— which is the merge table's own count, and a useful check that the parser is
reading what the study decided rather than what it would like.

All 105 are registered as adapter sets regardless, so every one is addressable
by name from the overlay and from `adapter_overrides`, including the ablation and
dose arms that exist as evidence rather than for serving. 274 adapters across 17
sets are now loadable.

The selector in the page pins one set for a whole turn instead, which is what
makes an A/B possible; `recipe` is the default and the only setting that follows
the measurements.

## Why a scream did not happen, and what changed

A real turn wrote `(a raw, tearing scream, completely overwhelmed by sudden
shock)` and produced no scream and loaded no scream adapter. Traced on that exact
script, there were three separate causes.

**1. The bracket was a direction, not a burst.** A round bracket without a number
is an instruction about how to *speak* the next sentence. `scream` is in the
vocabulary; `a raw, tearing scream, completely overwhelmed by sudden shock` is
not. So no `(scream, N.N seconds)` tag reached the model, no time was budgeted
for the sound, and no adapter was pulled. The prompt already told the director to
write the sound rather than describe it, and it described it anyway.

*Fixed by repairing rather than only instructing.* When a direction contains an
offerable burst label as a whole phrase, the direction is **kept** and a bare
burst bracket is inserted after it. The match is narrow on purpose — whole word,
and only labels with a measured recipe above the bar — which is what stops
`(spitting the words out)` from becoming a spit: `spitting` never realises, so it
is not offerable, so it is not repaired.

**2. Only one burst adapter was ever loaded per turn.** `detect_burst` returns a
single best match over the whole reply, chosen by *longest string*. That line
tagged both a scream and an exasperated sigh; `exasperated sigh` is the longer
name, so it won, and the scream lost — not on merit, on spelling. Now the tags
are read in order and each gets its own adapter, up to `BURST_MAX_ADAPTERS`.

**3. The weight was looked up by adapter name, not by class.** Found while
verifying the fix: two classes are served by ablation arms filed as
`ablation_d2_matched__scream`, whose tail is not the class name, so the lookup
missed and fell back to the flat 0.25 instead of the measured 1.5.

Verified end to end afterwards: the same request now produces
`(a raw, tearing scream …) (scream)` in the script, and loads
`ablation_d2_matched__scream @1.5` together with `sharp_inhale @2.3` — two
adapters, each at its own measured weight.

## Cue language

Cues are written in **English even when the spoken line is German**. This is the
corpus convention, not a preference: the German training lines read
`Das zerreisst einen einfach, weisst du? (relief sigh)` — German words, English
cue. A German cue is out of distribution.

This is now in both the director prompt and the skills block. Observed
afterwards: a German turn wrote `(exhausted groan)` for the burst — the rule
taking effect — while its delivery cue stayed German. So the rule is followed
for burst labels and only partly for directions, which is worth knowing before
anyone reads a single German cue as evidence that it does not work.

## The switch

Checkbox **Neue Skills** in the chat page, on by default; `MOSS_SKILLS=0` for the
server default. Off restores the previous hand-written block *and* the flat
0.25 / 0.5 dose, so the two are comparable rather than half-mixed. Agents are
built for both settings at boot — the flag changes only the system prompt, so it
costs a string each — and the choice is per request, without a restart.

## Measured so far

Ten prompts each way, one seed. Small, and reported as such:

| | skills on | skills off |
|---|--:|--:|
| bursts written | 9 | 9 |
| of those, from the reliable tier (hit ≥ 0.40) | **5** | 2 |
| impossible classes asked for | 0 | 0 |

The director writes about as many bursts either way but shifts toward the ones
that actually come out. Neither run asked for an impossible class, so the
36-class exclusion is unproven in behaviour here — it is a guard whose value
shows up in the tail, and ten prompts is not the tail.

**What is not measured yet:** whether the audio is better. Everything above is
what the director *writes* and which adapter is loaded at which weight. Whether
more bursts land, and whether the higher per-class doses cost intelligibility,
needs the detector and the transcription harness, and needs the listening the
recipes themselves were chosen with:
[laion/moss-vocal-burst-recipes](https://huggingface.co/spaces/laion/moss-vocal-burst-recipes).

## One correction from the same study

The burst+stop preference adapter is a **null on burst realisation**:
+0.007 / +0.017 / +0.006 at its three recommended checkpoints, none significant,
and the two adapters are redundant rather than additive — all of the gain is the
burst adapter. It is not harmful and step 896 buys genuineness (+0.044) on top,
so ship it for that if at all, never for bursts. It remains off by default with
its own checkbox, which the earlier preliminary signal in `ALIGNMENT.md` was
already too weak to justify changing.
