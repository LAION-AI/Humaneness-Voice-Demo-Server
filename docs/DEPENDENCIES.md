# Every model this server loads, with its URL

Checked against the Hub on 7 September 2026: **every repository below resolves.**
Nothing this server needs exists only on the machine it was built on. The paths
under `/mnt/nvme/…` that appear in `config.py` are caches — `config._root()`
falls back to the Hub copy whenever the local directory is absent, and prints
the repository name and `setup/fetch_all.py` when neither is there.

```bash
python setup/fetch_all.py --check     # what is present, downloads nothing
python setup/fetch_all.py             # fetch everything
python setup/fetch_all.py --minimal   # only what the server cannot start without
```

## Adapters

`config.LORA_ROOTS` maps each root to a directory; `config.HUB_FOR_ROOT` maps
the same root to the repository it came from.

The six `burst_*` roots are six arms of **one** 105-adapter release, split by
subdirectory. Counts verified against the repository file list.

## Not on the Hub

Two things, both of which ship **inside this repository**:

* **`wikiskills/`** — the burst recipes, the never-realise list and the
  interaction tables that `skills.py` parses. It is a directory here, not a
  model repository.

The listening evidence for those recipes **is** on the Hub, and an earlier
version of this page said otherwise:
[laion/moss-vocal-burst-recipes](https://huggingface.co/spaces/laion/moss-vocal-burst-recipes)
is a **Space** — 248 takes across the recipe classes, each marked with whether
the detector scored it a hit, plus weight-0 controls. Resolved 7 September 2026:
`api/spaces/…` 200, `api/models/…` 401, `api/datasets/…` 401. A checker that
looks only in the model namespace reports it dead; `SKILLS.md` cited it
correctly all along.
* **`wikiskills_legacy/`** — the same tree as it stood before the 2026-09-04
  revision, kept so an older result can be traced to the table that produced it.

Two more are **built**, not downloaded:

* the retrieval index — `python setup/build_retrieval_index.py`
* the voice profiles — `python setup/fetch_profile_refs3.py`

## The stack a measurement was made in is part of the measurement

This matters for anyone comparing numbers with us, and it is the reason two
groups can honestly disagree about a ceiling.

**Our burst ceiling is 1.25 and a single-adapter ladder gives 1.5.** Both are
right. The difference is what else is merged. Every take here already carries,
before a burst adapter is even considered:

| adapter | weight |
|---|--:|
| `sft3_dpo:p2` | 1.0 |
| `sft3_voice:<profile>` | 1.0 |
| `sft3_quality:genuineness_high` | 0.25 |
| `sft3_quality:blend_high` | 0.5 |
| `sft3_quality:esthetics_high` | 0.5 |
| `sft3_qdpo:quality_dpo` | 1.5 |
| `sft3_emotion:<retrieved>` | 1.0 |
| `sft3_voicenet:<axis>`, when the director picks one | up to 1.5 |

That is 5.75 to 7.25 of merged weight before the first burst. Measured under it,
**two burst adapters at 1.5 each destroy the line in 5 of 5 seeds** (median word
error 0.82), while one at 1.5 breaks none — it is the **sum** that breaks a line
here, which is exactly what a single-adapter ladder cannot see. Hence
`BURST_LAM_BUDGET = 2.0` and `BURST_LAM_MAX = 1.25`, with the weights scaled
rather than dropped when a turn wants more. The full table is in
[`BABBLE.md`](BABBLE.md) and the harness is `eval/sweetspot.py`.

**If you are reproducing this, fix the stack first.** `eval/why_babble.py` sets
it explicitly at the top; the constant is called `BASE`. Measuring the burst
adapters alone answers a different question, and both answers are worth having
as long as nobody mistakes one for the other.
