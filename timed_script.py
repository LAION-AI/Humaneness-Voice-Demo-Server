"""Turn the director's script into the timed script SFT3 was trained on.

SFT3's format carries its own arithmetic: every speech segment is preceded by
`[N.N seconds duration]`, every gap of 0.2 s or more by `[N.N seconds pause]`,
and every vocal burst is `(label, N.N seconds)`.  The Tokens field is the sum of
all of it at 12.5 frames per second, and when the numbers disagree with the
budget the model has to choose which to honour.

So the numbers are not left to the language model.  It writes the performance —
directions, bursts, where the silences fall — and this module does the
arithmetic, then makes the total match the budget exactly.  Getting a language
model to produce a set of decimals that sums to a given figure is a bad bet, and
length control is the one thing this checkpoint honours best.

Brackets are what tell the three tag kinds apart, and the rule is unforgiving:
square bracket = seconds; round bracket *with* a number = a burst; round bracket
*without* a number = a delivery direction.  A direction that picks up a number
becomes a burst, so directions here never carry one.

A round bracket without a number is then read one of two ways depending on
whether it NAMES a burst, and getting that wrong is silent: an unrecognised
label becomes a direction, the round bracket turns into an instruction about how
to speak, and no sound is produced.  The vocabulary is therefore taken from the
same wikiskills directory `skills.py` uses to decide what to offer the director
— see `burst_vocabulary()` — rather than from a second list that would drift.
