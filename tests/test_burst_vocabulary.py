"""The two burst vocabularies must not drift apart.

`skills.py` decides which sounds the director is OFFERED, from the wikiskills
tables.  `timed_script.py` decides which round brackets are READ as sounds.  If
the second is narrower than the first, the server offers a label, the director
writes it, and the bracket is silently re-read as a delivery direction: the round
bracket becomes an instruction about how to speak and no sound is produced.  No
error, no warning, just a recipe that cannot fire.

That is exactly what had happened.  `BURST_LABELS` was a hard-coded list of 22
while the wiki carried 117 pages; of the 36 classes `Skills.offerable` actually
offered, **9 were unrecognised** — including `guffaw` (measured hit 0.633, the
fourth-best recipe in the bank) and `clears_throat` (0.48).

Run directly (`python3 tests/test_burst_vocabulary.py`) or under pytest.  Parses
under 3.9, which is what the login node has.
