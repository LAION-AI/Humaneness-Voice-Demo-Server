"""Generate a turn N times and keep the best one.

The case for this is in the burst recipes themselves: they quote an `N` per
class — "at a hit rate of 0.27 it takes 8 candidates for 90 % confidence" — and
without best-of-N that column is advice nobody can act on.  The same holds for
the emotion adapters, whose own card says to generate several candidates and
rank them because the base model drifts under strong emotion.

All N candidates are one batched forward pass.  The streaming path is batch 1
because audio must start before the line ends; choosing between candidates is
the opposite situation, so it uses `generate_batch` and the whole set costs
little more than one take.

## The reward

    R = (norm(genuineness) + norm(blend) + 2 * norm(clap)
         + 2 * norm(burst)) * gate(WER)

`clap` is the cosine between the take's VoiceCLAP-commercial *audio* embedding
and the *text* embedding of what the director asked for — GENERAL plus every
round bracket in the script.  It carries double weight because it is the only
term that measures whether the take is the performance that was requested; the
other two measure whether it is a good take of anything.

`burst` is new (2026-09-07, study `vb_opt`, protocol section 71).  The four
terms above ask whether a take is good and whether it is the performance that
was requested.  None of them asks whether the SOUND the script names is
actually in the audio, and measured over 1,940 candidate sets only `clap`
tracks burst presence at all (r +0.148); `blend` points the wrong way (-0.084).
Restricted to the configuration the server is always in — a carrier voice with
its own `sft3_voice` adapter — the old reward's burst lift is +0.0104 (t 1.51),
indistinguishable from zero.  With this term the strict hit rate of the
DELIVERED take rises +0.0454 (t 7.60, +37 % relative), scored by a detector
other than the one ranking.  It is a trade: CLAP falls 0.0055 (t -6.82), which
is 3.6 % of the range a re-ranker can move.  See `config.BON_BURST_WEIGHT` for
why 2.0 and for the unguided caveat.

The term is `s_strict + 0.5*(s_fam - s_strict) + 0.25*s_pres + 0.5*agree`,
averaged over the bursts the turn actually requested.  A turn that requests none
carries **no `burst` key**, and `rank` then forces the term to exactly 0 so the
ranking is unchanged.  Note that leaving it to `_norm` is not enough: `_norm` of
a constant vector returns 0.5, and a constant inside the sum still re-weights
every candidate once the per-candidate WER gate multiplies it.

Normalisation is within the candidate set, not against an absolute scale.  Only
the ranking matters, the three scorers have unrelated ranges (0-6, 0-10, a
cosine), and their absolute values are not calibrated against human judgement
anyway.

`gate(WER)` is `1.0` when the inverse word error rate is above 0.85 and the
inverse rate itself below it.  Intelligibility is a threshold, not a
preference: a take everyone can understand should not beat another take everyone
can understand for being marginally more understandable, but a take that garbles
the line has to lose regardless of how good it sounds.
