# and for inline scripts no more than 0.25 absolute.

# table it sits above has not been rewritten to match and still carries ten
# recipes at 1.8-2.3, which is what skills.py parses and serves.  Those cells
# have their own passing absolute WER (sharp_inhale at 2.3 measured 0.091), so

# different delta.  Set MOSS_BURST_LAM_MAX=1.5 to enforce the addendum's ceiling.

# on the far side of it here.
#
# Not a contradiction of the study: its ladder measured ONE adapter, for several
# classes with no production stack under it, while a turn here merges it on top
# of a voice adapter, three quality adapters, a preference adapter, an emotion
# adapter and often a delivery axis.  The study saw the same edge from its own

# load adapters and write a good prompt.  Two more have since been measured on this
# checkpoint, together with how all three combine, and they are offered here as switchable
# modes.  docs/LEVERS.md is the write-up; the short version:
#
#   adapter        today's behaviour.  Merge weights.  The only lever that moves the quality
#                  axes at all (+0.399, t 6.0) and the cheapest everywhere.
#   adapter+steer  plus a difference-of-means direction added to the hidden state.  On the
#                  emotion heads the two are cleanly additive (interaction +0.038, t 1.36),
#                  and steering is five times the adapter's effect there (+0.384 t 9.4
#                  against +0.077 t 2.8).
#   adapter+cfg    plus classifier-free guidance on the delivery condition.  Costs 1.93x.
#   steer / cfg    one lever without the attribute's own adapter.  For the delivery axes,
#                  where adapter and steering are significantly SUB-additive (-0.164,
#                  t -3.7) and the right move is to pick one rather than stack them.
#
# Default is `auto`, which resolves per family from the measurements: emotion ->
# adapter+steer, delivery -> adapter, quality -> adapter.  `auto` never spends guidance.

# though the scoring models liked it.  That is the documented blind spot of this
# evidence — the steering study states plainly that no listening test was run on
# any of its results, and every figure in it is one model judging another model's

# ------------------------------------------------------- preference adapters
# Both repositories publish their recommended checkpoint at the root, not their
# final one, and both argue against the final in their own cards:
#
#   quality_dpo      root == step376.  The preference task is solved there
#                    (accuracy 1.0000); every later step only inflates the
#                    reward margin -- about 1 nat per token of drift away from
#                    the reference model for no measured gain.  step1504 is
#                    fetched alongside as `quality_dpo_step1504` so the two can
#                    be compared by ear, which nobody has done.
#   burst_stop_dpo   root == step896, and the card says "use 896, not final":
#                    step902 is a 6-step tail and the only late reversal.

# burst_stop is the one whose evidence points at this server's open complaints:
# on 317 held-out pairs pooled accuracy 0.707 -> 0.943, and the checkpoint it
# started from scored 0.258 on two-sentence stops -- below chance, i.e. it
# actively preferred the take that keeps talking.  Off by default all the same,
# because nobody has heard it.
