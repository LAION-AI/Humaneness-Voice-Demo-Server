"""Benchmark items as acting briefs.

A benchmark item arrives as a JSON object: an emotion target, a situation, a
performance direction and — the part that matters — a script that must be
spoken *exactly* as written.  Handed that raw, a 12B model has to parse JSON,
work out which of nine fields is the line, and follow two hundred lines of
format rules at the same time.  It reliably fails the first step and answers
*about* the elevator instead of performing the sentence about it.

So the JSON never reaches the model.  `detect` recognises an item, `brief`
rewrites it as a short imperative task, and `verbatim_ok` checks afterwards that
the words came back unchanged.  `annotate` is the floor: a correct, plainly
directed rendering of the item, used when the model drifts off the script.
