"""The measured knowledge layer, rendered into something the director can read.

`wikiskills/` is a generated corpus: sixty attribute pages, a machine-readable
`coefficients.json` the lever planner already reads, and `VOCAL_BURSTS.md`, which
is the part that changes what the director should write.  This module turns the
burst tables into two things the server can act on — a per-class merge weight and
a prompt block naming the sounds that actually exist.

Why it matters more than a documentation update: the instructions this server was
shipping contradict the measurements in two places.

  * It told the director to place bursts **mid-sentence**.  Measured, mid-clause
    placement is worse on 15 of 15 classes (-0.07..-0.12 hit rate, miss rate
    +0.31..+0.37, t 8-10).  One inversion: `clears_throat` goes 0.250 -> 0.483.
  * It offered every burst that has an adapter.  Nineteen classes never realise
    at any dose under either prompt form, and seventeen more sit below the 0.15
    bar.  Every mouth class and every whistle class in the bank is on one of
    those lists.  Offering them produces a silent take and no warning.

And one thing it did not know: the useful merge weight is **per class** and runs
0.25 to 2.3, against the flat 0.25 / 0.5 shipped here.

The tables are parsed rather than transcribed, for the same reason the wiki is
generated rather than typed: a copy stops agreeing with its source the moment
either moves.

        an instruction about how to speak the next sentence — so the label inside
