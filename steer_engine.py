"""Steering vectors: a direction added to the model's own hidden state while it generates.

    h  <-  h + alpha * (v / ||v||) * ||h||

This is the second of the three levers the training side measured (the first is the LoRA
merge weight this server already uses, the third is guidance — see `cfg` in `tts_engine.py`).
The mechanism, the normalisation and the injection points are ported from the research
harness `actf_steer.py` (`Injector`, `build_specs`) rather than re-derived, because the
convention is load-bearing in two places that are easy to get wrong:

**alpha is dimensionless.**  It is the fraction of the CURRENT hidden state's own magnitude
added along `v`, not an absolute step.  Raw difference-vector norms span three orders of
magnitude across the 36 layers (||h|| runs 6.4 at the embeddings to 2237 at layer 35), so a
fixed absolute alpha would be a no-op in one place and a catastrophe in another.

**Only the last position of each forward pass is steered.**  During the prefill that is the
position that emits frame 0; during decoding it is the single new frame slot.  So exactly the
positions whose hidden state produces a generated frame are steered, and the prompt's own
representation is left alone.

WHERE THE VECTORS COME FROM.  A 99-dimension library extracted from this checkpoint's own
activations, one difference-of-means direction per (attribute, layer).  The full research
file is 112 MB and is NOT in this repository; `setup/build_steering_pack.py` distils it to
the ~5 MB the server actually needs — each dimension at its own top-5 layers — and
`config.STEER_PACK` points at the result.  With no pack on disk every steering mode
degrades to `adapter` and says so in the response payload.  See docs/LEVERS.md.

WHICH LAYERS.  Per attribute, not global: Anger is most decodable at h21 h20 h19, genuineness
at h12 h13 h21, blend at h25 h22 h20.  `taps: "top1"` means "that attribute's own best layer".
k is small and per family — emotion is free only at k = 1, the quality axes break at k >= 2,
the delivery axes want 3-5.

COST.  These are forward hooks, and `docs/ADAPTERS.md` §1 records that forward hooks for the
whole adapter stack took the realtime factor from 0.737 to 1.29 and were rejected.  That was
**536 extra kernel launches per token**.  This is one to five, each a norm and a fused
multiply-add on a [1, 1, 2560] slice, which is the regime §2 already accepted for the twelve
tied-module hooks ("twelve hooks is not 536").  It has not been measured on this hardware —
see the smoke test asked for in the pull request.
